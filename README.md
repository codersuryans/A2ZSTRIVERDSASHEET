# 🚀 Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet Progress  

This repository contains my solutions and progress for [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/).  
I’ll be updating it daily with the problems I solve.

---

## 📅 Day 1 - Sorting Algorithms  

✅ Completed the following algorithms:  
- Selection Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Recursive Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  

### 📂 Code Files  
- `SelectionSort.java`  
- `BubbleSort.java`  
- `RecursiveBubbleSort.java`  
- `InsertionSort.java`  
- `MergeSort.java`  

---

## 🏆 Goals
- Stay consistent with daily problem-solving  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Master Data Structures & Algorithms

## 🚀 Day 2 – Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet Progress  

✅ Completed the following problems today:  
- **Insertion Sort (Iterative & Recursive)**  
- **Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer Approach)**  
- Practiced problem variations related to sorting  

📌 Concepts Learned:
- How insertion sort shifts elements instead of swapping.  
- Recursive implementation of insertion sort.  
- Merge sort’s time complexity O(n log n) and how it performs better than quadratic sorts.  

🛠️ Language Used: **Java**  

👉 Committed all codes to the repository for tracking consistency.
