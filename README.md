# 🚀 Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet Progress  

This repository contains my solutions and progress for [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/).  
I’ll be updating it daily with the problems I solve.

## 📅 Day 1 - Sorting Algorithms  

✅ Completed the following algorithms:  
- Selection Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Recursive Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  

### 📂 Code Files  
- `SelectionSort.java`  
- `BubbleSort.java`  
- `RecursiveBubbleSort.java`  
- `InsertionSort.java`  
- `MergeSort.java`

## 🏆 Goals
- Stay consistent with daily problem-solving  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Master Data Structures & Algorithms

## 🚀 Day 2 – Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet Progress  

✅ **Recursive Insertion Sort**  
✅ **Quick Sort**  
✅ **Largest Element in an Array**  
✅ **Second Largest Element in an Array (without sorting)**  
✅ **Check if the Array is Sorted**  
✅ Day 3

Check if the Array is Sorted

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Left Rotate an Array by One Place

Left Rotate an Array by D Places

✅ Day 4

Union of Two Sorted Arrays

Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays

Find the Missing Element in an Array

Maximum Consecutive Ones

💡 Consistency is the key! Each day I’m solving problems and getting one step closer to mastering DSA. 💻

📌 **Concepts Learned**:  
- Recursive approach to insertion sort.  
- Partition logic and recursive calls in quick sort.  
- Efficient ways to find the largest and second largest elements without sorting.  
- Iterative method to verify if an array is sorted.  

🛠️ **Language Used**: Java
